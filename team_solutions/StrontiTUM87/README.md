# QuEra_challenge


The notebooks in this folder are mostyl unorganised and not really usable as they are.


To get an idea what which notebook was used for what:
* PlotNotebookParams.ipynb: plotting the 3D probability graphs from the output given by parameter_sweep.ipynb
* PlotNotebookAquila.ipynb: plotting the probability graphs for the Aquila output produced by aquila_sweep.ipyn
* Aquila_sweep.ipynb: submitting our Aquila sweep to aquila
* Parameter_sweep.ipynb: sweeping the parameters for the optimal rydberg radius and other purposes
* Delta_optimisation.ipynb: optimising the shape of Delta(t)
